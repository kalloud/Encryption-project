# Encryption-project

## Cryptography with Java
This repository contains documentation of the object oriented programming project.

We implemented a simple text encryption protocol that allows us to:

* Modify a character given by another
* Modify a string given by another
* Decode encrypted texts based on the occurrence of characters
